      <h2><em>How to read and understand your free credit scores</em></h1>
        <p>Your credit scores can be a useful reflection of your overall credit health. But to get the most out of your scores, you must first understand how they work, what they represent and what actually constitutes a good credit score.</p>  
        <h4 class="blue-text" ><strong>Excellent (781â€“850)</strong></h4>
        <p>You may qualify for the best financial products available, and youâ€™ll likely have several options when it comes to choosing repayment periods or other terms. But excellent credit scores arenâ€™t the only factor in a lending decision â€” a lender could still deny your application for another reason.</p>
        <h4 class="green-text"><strong>Good (661â€“780)</strong></h4>
        <p>Youâ€™re less likely to have an application denied based solely on your credit scores, compared to having scores in the fair or poor range, and youâ€™re more likely to be offered a low interest rate and favorable terms.</p>
        <h4 class="orange-text"><strong>Fair (581â€“660)</strong></h4>
        <p>You may have several options when it comes to getting approved for a financial product, but you might not qualify for the best terms.</p>
        <h4 class="red-text"><strong>Poor (300â€“580)</strong></h4>
        <p>You may find it difficult to get approved for many loans or unsecured credit cards. And if youâ€™re approved, you might not qualify for the best terms or lowest interest rate.</p>
